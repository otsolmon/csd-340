                    <figcaption>Last three years, I discovered a new hobby which is skin care. It started with acne
                        and dark spots on my skin. I learned a lot of things about my skin type, skin care products
                        and their ingredients to take care of my skin. It became part of my morning and evening routine.

                        Also, my friends and family gave me some of them. I love the scents because each fragrance
                        holds a special memory. When I smell them, they bring me back to the past and give me joy.
